<!-- This is a temporary page meant to be used for routes or pages that are incomplete AND/OR actively being worked on. Intended for use during demos, user testing, or video showcases to prevent empty routes from linking back to home and showing active upcoming work is being done on the site. NOT intended for use as a standalone page- simply route to it with '/construction' in any href attribute. 
 
IF ALTERING COLLECTION LINKS: As of 4/16, all of our collection links that are intended to go to CollectiveAccess link to THIS page. Be sure to update collection links in the footer, the collection page itself, and the home page.
