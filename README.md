# N420 MARLA Website

The following project is a website for the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering's Media Arts Research and Learning Lab (MARLA) in IU Indianapolis. The site was built using the Svelte framework by IU Indy students CJ Eilestine and Jeremy Black for the N420 Project Development class.

## How to run

If viewing and/or editing the code, clone the repository and ensure `node` is downloaded by running `npm i` or `npm install` in the projects' terminal. To ensure icons are visible, run `npm i @iconify/svelte` to install Iconify.

To view the project on a live server, run `dev` from NPM Scripts or run `vite dev` in the terminal to get the localhost running. A clickable link will be displayed in the terminal that will take you to the live. The live updates as the code updates in real-time, so you don't need to refresh or re-reun the `dev` script to see site updates.
